# About this Repo
This repository is my companion to the Manning Press book 'Designing APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI'.  It 
contains the FrontEnd, BackEnd, API definitions and any information on setup

## FrontEnd
The Front End application will be React.js

## BackEnd
The Back End application will be based on Node.js, perhaps with Express.js

## Database/Storage
TBD, but likely something like MongoDB

## API Definitions
Will follow OpenAPI 3+ standards, using SwaggerUI.
